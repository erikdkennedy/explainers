  <p>I'm Erik Kennedy. I am a <a href="https://erikdkennedy.com" target="_blank">freelance UI/UX designer</a> and teach design at <a href="https://learnui.design">Learn UI Design</a>.</p>
  <p>Have you ever heard the career reflection question, “what feels like <em>play</em> to you but <em>work</em> to others?”</p>
  <p>For me, I realized the answer is: <em>breaking down complex topics into simple explanations</em>.</p>
  <p>So… I started this blog! My only goal is to create great explanations for deep questions – on the efficient frontier of <em>accurate</em> and <em>accessible</em>.</p>
  <p>I am open to feedback, corrections, and article requests. <a href="mailto:erik@explainers.blog">Email me</a>. ✌️</p>
